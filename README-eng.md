### Steps to Create an Executable with PyInstaller

1. **Install PyInstaller**  
   PyInstaller is a Python library that allows you to create executables:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the Executable**  
   In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile my_script.py
   ```

   - `--onefile`: Creates a single executable file instead of a folder with multiple files.

3. **Result**  
   - PyInstaller generates a `dist/` folder in the current directory.
   - The executable can be found in `dist/my_script` or `dist/my_script.exe` (depending on the operating system).

### Additional Options for PyInstaller

- **Add an Icon to the Executable**: Use the `--icon` option to include a custom icon:
  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile --icon=my_icon.ico my_script.py
  ```

- **Silent Mode**: Add the `--noconsole` option to suppress the console window during execution (useful for GUI applications):
  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole my_script.py
  ```

### Using `--name`

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name my_executable my_script.py
```

- **`--onefile`**: Creates a single executable file.
- **`--name my_executable`**: The generated executable file will be named `my_executable.exe` (Windows) or `my_executable` (Linux/macOS), regardless of the Python script name.
- **`my_script.py`**: The source Python script.

### Creating a Portable Executable

The generated executables include all the necessary dependencies, making them portable. However, if you use native libraries or external resources, ensure they are compatible with the target system.

### Remove Temporary Files Generated by PyInstaller

PyInstaller generates several temporary files and unnecessary folders after creating the executable. You can remove them with these commands:

```bash
rm -rf build/
rm -rf __pycache__/
rm my_script.spec
```
